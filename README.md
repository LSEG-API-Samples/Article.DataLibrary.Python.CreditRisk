# Understand and Retrieve your portfolio's credit risk exposures

A UK based food manufacturer has excess cash and has set up its own fund to invest into equities and shares. For reporting purposes, this company wants to know for each position in their 15 portfolios, what is its credit exposure? By knowing the price of the CDS 5Y, the food manufacturer can determine how much they have to pay to offset the credit risk associated to an instrument within a portfolio. When utilizing Refinitiv's desktop Portfolio management tools, users have access to a powerful suite of details. Unfortunately, the credit exposure information is neither available directly within the portfolio nor in any templates of the portfolio reporting tool.

Does that mean itâ€™s not possible to provide this information when the CDS 5Y price is quoted by Refinitiv? Absolutely not! In this article, we will describe how to leverage Python to enrich the portfolio details with the credit risk exposures.

Refer to the [Credit Risk Exposure Article](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/article-catalog/article/understand-and-retrieve-your-portfolio-s-credit-risk-exposures) defined within the Refinitiv Developer Community for more details.
